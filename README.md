## Photoshop

Designing in 3D has never been easier. Create 3D scenes, edit materials, and model 3D objects. Control the outcome of your design work.

## Interface

Getting to Know the Photoshop Interface, Photoshop Window consists of the followings:

### `Menu Bar`
The menu bar is used to open and save files, adjust the canvas size, access some of the editing tools, open and close various windows, and more. It contains 11 items:

 <h2 align="center">Menu Bar</h2>
</p>

### `Tool Bar`
Tools bar appears on the left side of the window. By holding individual tools you will see grouped tools.

 <h2 align="center">Tool Bar</h2>
</p>

### `Options Bar`
Options bar is a horizontal menu at the top of the main Photoshop window that lets you customize a tool. It changes according to individual tools.

 <h2 align="center">Text Options Bar</h2>
</p>

### `Document Window`
The Document window is the large area in the center of the interface where the image is displayed. It's also where we edit the image. The actual area where the image is visible is known as the canvas.

### `Status Bar`
The status bar is located at the bottom of every document window and displays useful informationâ€”such as the current magnification and file size.

 <h2 align="center">Status Bar</h2>
</p>

### `Panel Columns`
Panels are available in both Photoshop Elements and Elements Organizer; however, they behave a little differently in each. Panels help you manage, monitor, and modify images. Some panels have menus that provide additional commands and options. You can organize panels in the basic and custom workspaces in Expert mode.
- Color
- Adjustments
- Layers

</p>

### `Secondary Panel Column`
So far, we've been focusing all of our attention on the main panel column, but there's also a secondary column to its left. This second column can seem a little confusing at first because by default, the panels in this column appear only as icons.
